# Medical Image Classification with CNN ‚Äî Breast Cancer Detection

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect breast cancer from medical images. The model was trained and evaluated using a large dataset of labeled images **sourced from [Kaggle‚Äôs Breast Histopathology Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)**, achieving promising accuracy and balanced precision/recall metrics.

## üéØ Objectives

- Train a CNN model to classify images into cancerous and non-cancerous categories.
- Handle class imbalance with appropriate data splits and weighting.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics including AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualize model decisions using Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability.
- Provide a clear workflow for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üñºÔ∏è Results & Deployment
### üî¨ Tumor Detection Output (Example)

Here is an example of a prediction made by the model with a corresponding heatmap:

![Real Tumors Placement](heatmaps/real_heatmap_result.png)


### ‚öôÔ∏è API & Docker Deployment

To make the model usable by clinicians or external systems, I developed a REST API using **FastAPI**. The API accepts histology images, processes them, and returns the classification result along with a heatmap highlighting potential tumor zones.

The full application is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment and scalability. It was tested and deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**, allowing remote access and facilitating integration in clinical workflows or research platforms.

The repo contains:
- `app/` folder with FastAPI logic
- `Dockerfile` for image building
- `notebooks/` to see the model creation steps

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- TensorFlow / Keras for model building and training
- Python 3.8+
- Kaggle for dataset and notebook environment
- Matplotlib, OpenCV for visualization
- Git & GitHub for version control
- FastAPI and Docker for smooth deployement
