# Medical Image Classification with CNN ‚Äî Breast Cancer Detection

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect breast cancer from medical images. The model was trained and evaluated using a large dataset of labeled images **sourced from [Kaggle‚Äôs Breast Histopathology Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)**, achieving promising accuracy and balanced precision/recall metrics.

## üéØ Objectives

- Train a CNN model to classify images into cancerous and non-cancerous categories.
- Handle class imbalance with appropriate data splits and weighting.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics including AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualize model decisions using Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability.
- Provide a clear workflow for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.
